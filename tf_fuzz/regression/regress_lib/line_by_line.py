The functions here perform straight-forward line-by-line comparisons of regression 
TF-Fuzz regression tests.  These are not sufficient to address cases where the PSA
calls are randomized.

Each given line of the expected files (exp_stdout_stderr and exp_test.c) functions
as Python regex for the corresonding line in the actual/generated corresponding
file.  Actually, the expected-file lines may need a little bit of tweaking first.
There are three scenarios:
*  The line in exp_* file contains no regex content at all.  In this case, the two
   lines must be exactly identical, character for character. The actual/generated 
   output files do not contain regexes, but can contain parentheses or other 
   characters that "look like" regex content, and thus confuse re.match().  So, 
   it's first checked for an exact string == match. 
*  The line in the exp_* file contains one or more standard-Python regex patterns
   to match.  In this case, a Python re.match() will still report a match.
*  The line in the exp_* file contains one or more non-standard regex pattern, in
   which case that non-standard regex pattern needs to be replaced with the actual,
   expected character string.

As described in the above-cited README, these non-standard regex wildcards in the 
exp_* files take either of two formats:
*  "@@@" a 3-digit pattern number "@@@" (e.g., "@@@005@@@"):  This denotes a
   pattern of no particular length that must match the same text every occurrence
   in the actual/generated file.
*  "@@" a 3-digit pattern number "@" a 2-digit length in chars "@@":  Same idea as
   the previous pattern, except that it also has a specific length.
   
To address these special regex wildcards, check_gen_test() below has to:
1.  Isolate the wildcard from the rest of the string,
2.  Check that wildcard against a Python dictionary relating the wildcard name to 
    its expected-text substitution value,
3.  If not present in the dictionary, create a new dictionary entry relating the 
    wildcard text to the text found in that spot in the actual/generated file,
4.  Replace that wildcard text with the expected value from the hash, then
5.  As with all lines, perform the re.match() between the two lines.

mask_other_wildcards(), used by resolve_wildcards() below, is used in harvesting
the value of a certain wildcard of the sort described above.  After the caller
replaces the wildcard of interest with a regex to retrieve that data from actual-
output file, it passes the string into here, to replace all other wildcards with
"anything goes" regexes.

resolve_wildcards() resolves wildcards of the sort described above, in an expected
file line (exp) from a wildcard dictionary (wildcard_dict).  In particular, it
replaces them with what the wildcards are found to stand for in the actual test 
output (act).  If it encounters a wildcard it has not seen before, it adds it to 
the dictionary, based upon what's in the test.c output.  Further occurrences of that
wildcard, it pulls from the wildcard dictionary, meaning that the subsequent 
occurrences must resolve to the same text string.
