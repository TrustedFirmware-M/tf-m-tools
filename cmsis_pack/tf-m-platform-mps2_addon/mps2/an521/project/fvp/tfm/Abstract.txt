TF-M Project Template
---------------------

Target: Arm MPS2+ AN521 FVP (Fixed Virtual Platform)

Workspace contains the following projects:
 - tfm_s:  TF-M firmware with secure services running on the secure side
 - tfm_ns: Template for application running on the non-secure side

TF-M firmware on the secure side runs first and then transfers execution
to the non-secure application.

Running the example:
 - build project for the secure side (tfm_s)
 - build project for the non-secure side (tfm_ns)
 - start the debug session and run the target
