Introduction
************

This directory contains C++ header and program files for classes of objects that
track PSA assets, while generating a directed-random test.  Notably this is
during the Simulate phase, after Parse phase, which parses the test-template
file, and prior to writing out the generated C code.

***********************************************
``.../tools/tf_fuzz/assets`` directory contents
***********************************************
.. code-block:: bash

    crypto_asset.cpp  psa_asset.cpp  sst_asset.cpp
    crypto_asset.hpp  psa_asset.hpp  sst_asset.hpp

These hold current state of those assets as the run is simulated, after the
exact sequence of PSA commands to be executed is generated by the Parse stage.
Simulation only occurs to a level of detail of being able to predict pass/fail
status, and asset data.  Generally speaking, it does not simulate
secure-partition code.
